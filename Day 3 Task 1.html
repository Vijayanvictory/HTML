        <li><h3>Know thyself</h3></li>
        <p>It is very important to know yourself well, so that you know how can you bring the best out of yourself. Use SWOT model (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) and get over your weaknesses.</p>
        <li><h3>Develop skills</h3></li>
        <p>Make a list of skills that are crucial to achieve your desired goals which may include – a formal degree, technical certifications, membership of certain body etc. Start to get them one by one.</p>
        <li><h3>Get a mentor</h3></li>
        <p>It is very important to find a good mentor who will act as your guiding star. Nominate someone as your mentor – follow his/her track. Also get like-minded friends through platforms like –  Meet-up, LinkedIn.</p>
