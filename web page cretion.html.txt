	<center> This is all about MICROSOFT EDGE Browser </center>

      <h1> Microsoft Edge :) </h1>
<p> Microsoft Edge (or simply Edge) is a proprietary, cross-platform web browser created by Microsoft. It was first released in 2015 as part of Windows 10 and Xbox One and later ported to other platforms as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source project: Android and iOS,[8][9] macOS, older Windows versions (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later were supported until early 2023),[10][11] and most recently Linux.[12][13] Edge was created as the successor to Internet Explorer (IE).

Edge was initially built with Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine, EdgeHTML, and their Chakra JavaScript engine.[14] In late 2018, it was announced that Edge would be completely rebuilt as a Chromium-based[15][16] browser with Blink and V8 engines. The new Edge was publicly released in January 2020,[17][18] and on Xbox platforms in 2021.[19][20] Microsoft has since terminated security support for the original browser (now referred to as Microsoft Edge Legacy),[21] and in Windows 11 it is the default web browser (for compatibility[22][23] with Google Chrome).[24]

In May 2022, according to StatCounter, Microsoft Edge became the second most popular browser in the world, overtaking Apple's Safari (in some countries, such as the United States, Edge is the 3rd most popular, where it has a 14% share, slightly behind Safari's 16% share). As of September 2022, Edge is used by 11 percent of PCs worldwide.[25]</p>

<h3> Feature: </h3>

<p> Microsoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows 11, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Explorer Mobile.[26] As its development and release is dependent on the model of Windows as a service, it is not included in Windows 10 Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds.[27][28][29]

Microsoft initially announced that Edge would support the legacy MSHTML (Trident) browser engine for backward compatibility, but later said that, due to "strong feedback," Edge would use a new engine, while Internet Explorer would continue to provide the legacy engine.[30] The developer toolset of the EdgeHTML-based versions featured an option to emulate the rendering behaviour ("document mode") of Internet Explorer versions 5 to 11.[31][32]

Favorites, reading list, browsing history and downloads are viewed at the Hub,[33] a sidebar providing functionality similar to Internet Explorer's Downloads manager and Favorites Center.[34]

Edge features a built-in PDF reader,[35] and supports WebAssembly. Until January 2021, Edge also featured an integrated Adobe Flash Player (with an internal whitelist allowing Flash applets on Facebook websites to load automatically, bypassing all other security controls requiring user activation).[36]

Edge does not support legacy technologies such as ActiveX and Browser Helper Objects, instead it uses an extension system. </P>


<h3> Release strategy: </h3>
<p> Microsoft Edge Legacy's release cadence was tied to the Windows 10 release cycle and used the Windows Insider Program to preview new versions of the browser. These pre-release builds were known as "Edge Preview". Every major release of Windows included an updated version of Edge and its render engine.

On April 8, 2019, Microsoft announced the introduction of four preview channels: Canary, Dev, Beta, and Stable and launched the Canary and Dev channels that same day with the first preview builds, for those channels, of the new Edge. Microsoft collectively calls the Canary, Dev, and Beta channels the "Microsoft Edge insider channels".[48] As a result, Edge updates were decoupled from new versions of Windows. Major versions of Edge Stable are now scheduled for release every 4 weeks, closely following Chromium version releases. </P>
