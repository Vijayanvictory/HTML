        Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware. <br><br> WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;[18] all Chrome variants except iOS used Blink as of 2017.[19]
        
        As of October 2022, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 67% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[20] is most used on tablets (having surpassed Safari), and is also dominant on smartphones[21][22] and at 65% across all platforms combined, making it the most used web browser in the world today. <br><br>Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products: ChromeOS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.</p>
